# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built in Python using Google Colab. The goal is to suggest movies similar to a user-provided title based on their content features, such as plot descriptions or genres.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- Content-based recommendation using cosine similarity
- Preprocessing and feature extraction with Python libraries
- Clean, explainable code and workflow
- Ready for future enhancements (collaborative filtering, hybrid models, deep learning, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
- (Optional) Streamlit/Gradio for frontend (planned)
- GitHub for version control

## 📌 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather movie metadata (titles, genres, plot summaries, etc.)

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean and transform data (handling missing values, text normalization)

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Generate TF-IDF vectors or other embeddings

4. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - Use cosine similarity to find similar movies

5. **Frontend (Planned)**  
   - Streamlit or Gradio interface for user-friendly interaction

---

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Open the Colab notebook (`MovieRec.ipynb`)
2. Follow the cells step by step
3. Enter a movie title in the user input section
4. Get a list of similar movies recommended by the system

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Integrate collaborative filtering
- Deploy with Streamlit or Gradio
- Add a Flask or FastAPI backend if needed
- Host on a cloud platform
